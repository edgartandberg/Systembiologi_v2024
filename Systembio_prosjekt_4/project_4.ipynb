    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will be continuing your work with the *Escherichia coli* core model and investigate how the growth phenotype of the model changes when varying one or multiple exchange fluxes. Additionally, you will be conducting a gene essentiality analysis on the model where the deletion of a gene can be simulated by simply constraining the lower and upper flux bounds of its associated reactions to 0. Gene deletion analysis is a common application of genome-scale metabolic models and allow us to assess the effects of a gene deletion on the metabolic phenotype of an organism before initiating expensive and time-consuming experiments in the lab. I recommend taking a look at the `cobrapy` documentation before starting with the project, particularly the section on deletion analysis found [here](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deletions.html).\n",
